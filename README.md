# The Gaming Room (SNHU Project)

The following is a reflection on the "Gaming Room" design document process. The design document can be found [here](CS%20230%20Project%20Software%20Design%20-%20Final.pdf)

## Project Overview
The Gaming Room needed a scalable, web-based version of their Android game, Draw It or Lose It, to support thousands of players across multiple platforms. The solution incorporated Linux-based hosting, microservices, and WebSockets for real-time interaction, ensuring efficiency, security, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Documentation Strengths & Process
The strongest aspect of the documentation was the detailed evaluation of operating platforms, leading to a well-justified Linux-based cloud solution. Working through the design document helped identify challenges early, improving architectural decisions before coding.

## Impact of the Design Document
Creating the design document provided a structured approach to development, ensuring clear system architecture, security considerations, and scalability strategies. This process helped streamline coding by defining requirements up front to ensure a smooth coding process.

## Revisions & Improvements
If revising, I would refine distributed systems and networking details, ensuring better latency management and failover strategies.

## User Needs & Software Design
The Gaming Room needed a cross-platform, scalable, and real-time gaming experience. To meet this, the design focused on cloud-based infrastructure, WebSockets for low-latency communication, and a responsive web interface to ensure smooth gameplay on desktop and mobile. Security was also a priority, leading to data encryption, authentication mechanisms, and secure API practices to protect user information.

## Future Development Approach
User needs shaped the responsive, scalable, and accessible design. Future projects will continue emphasizing modular architectures, security-first approaches, and efficient cloud solutions to enhance performance and maintainability.
